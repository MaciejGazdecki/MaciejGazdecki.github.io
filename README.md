# RWD-SASS-Flexbox-Projekt

This is my first RWD project, which I created during my Bootcamp in CodersLab. In this project I used all my knowledge regarding Sass and CSS and
I handled all Flexbox properties as well as @media to create breakpoints. I obtained from my professor a template of the project and
I had to write the entite code, both html and Sass. To convert the scss files I used Gulp. This page is perfectly scaled for
all small devices as well as for tablets and large desktops up tu 1920*1080px.

I hope you like it :)
